This is what we think of science fiction.

We think that it could do better.

We have looked to SF for new ways of thinking and feeling about gender.

We have looked to it for cyborgs and aliens, for creatures whose strangeness shows us the strangeness in ourselves.

We have looked beyond the binary, beyond Nature, beyond gender.

We have looked for SF that is trans-inclusive, that is anti-essentialist, that adopts an intersectional lens.

We have looked for SF that embraces a utopian perspective, that opens up space for radical change.

We have looked for SF that rejects Eurocentrism and moves beyond its own white, western canon.
