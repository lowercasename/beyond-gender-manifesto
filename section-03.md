This is what we expect from science fiction.

We expect more.

We expect SF to provide us with more than a seat at the table. We expect it to overturn the table, to transform it into a barricade, to set the table on fire.

We expect SF to challenge us, to shake loose possibility, to construct new worlds.

We expect the process of writing and reading SF to be transformative.

We expect SF to acknowledge its power, to take responsibility for its potential for violence, for its potential for cruelty.

We expect SF to support us in our efforts to dismantle systems of oppression and exclusion.

We expect SF to offer us more than the possible.

We expect SF to provide us with tools to dismantle dominant narratives of gender, race, class; to inspire us with new futures; to stoke our rage at the present.

We expect SF to be prepared to transform itself.

We expect to see ourselves in SF.

We expect SF to trouble categorisation.

We expect SF to establish points of connection with our alien kin.

We expect SF to reveal the wondrous strangeness of the present.
