The white capitalist queerphobic patriarchy is heavily invested in making sure its cruel fictions are not thought otherwise; making sure that SF writers don’t reveal to their readers how strange everything is, in this, and in other possible worlds.

SF has been historically dominated by the “universal”; the cis white male middle-class; chiselled white jaws above the collar of his space suit; birds nest hair topping white face, whiter scientist’s coat. The adventurer of colonial fiction in other garb.

This is of course a fiction (it’s silly but it’s still cruel) which risks the elision/(is disturbed by the ghosts) of our forebears. However, the image remains. How do we move beyond?

More is needed than simply the repeated calls for change. Important as they are, such tactics have not moved us far enough.

Instead, we should pay attention to the material production of SF. And so a new set of questions emerge. Who writes science fiction, and why? Who owns the means of publishing and distribution? What excludes those voices who could truly move us beyond into the better?

These are our questions, these our expectations. We work to see them answered, to see them met, to move beyond them into the realms of impossibility.
